## Basic Helpers for ProcessWire Modules

The aim of this teeny-tiny Composer package is to add helper traits to ProcessWire modules and associated classes. Theyâ€™re being released seperately as the all my modules use them (or parts of them), and each module release will always have the latest version of them. Feel free to use them in your projects as well. Simply require the package `rockett/pw-module-helpers` and import the traits where you need them. Other common classes may be added in future, and some traits may be converted to static classes for easier reference (though, in my opinion, traits are good enough).

### License

As with all my modules, this package is released under the [ISC License](LICENSE.md).
